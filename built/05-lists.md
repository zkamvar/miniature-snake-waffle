- How can I store many values together?

</div>

Similar to a string that can contain many characters, a list is a container that can store many values.
Unlike NumPy arrays,
lists are built into the language (so we don't have to load a library
to use them).
We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separating the values with commas:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
```

```output
odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

We can access elements of a list using indices -- numbered positions of elements in the list.
These positions are numbered starting at 0, so the first element has an index of 0.

```python
print('first element:', odds[0])
print('last element:', odds[3])
print('"-1" element:', odds[-1])
```

```output
first element: 1
last element: 7
"-1" element: 7
```

Yes, we can use negative numbers as indices in Python. When we do so, the index `-1` gives us the
last element in the list, `-2` the second to last, and so on.
Because of this, `odds[3]` and `odds[-1]` point to the same element here.

If we loop over a list, the loop variable is assigned to its elements one at a time:

```python
for number in odds:
    print(number)
```

```output
1
3
5
7
```

There is one important difference between lists and strings:
we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change individual characters in a string.
For example:

```python
names = ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']  # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
names[1] = 'Darwin'  # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
```

```output
names is originally: ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Curie', 'Darwin', 'Turing']
```

works, but:

```python
name = 'Darwin'
name[0] = 'd'
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-8-220df48aeb2e> in <module>()
      1 name = 'Darwin'
----> 2 name[0] = 'd'

TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

does not.

## Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
Data which can be modified in place is called [mutable](reference/#mutable),
while data which cannot be modified is called [immutable](reference/#immutable).
Strings and numbers are immutable. This does not mean that variables with string or number values
are constants, but when we want to change the value of a string or number variable, we can only
replace the old value with a completely new value.
Lists and arrays, on the other hand, are mutable: we can modify them after they have been
created. We can change individual elements, append new elements, or reorder the whole list. For
some operations, like sorting, we can choose whether to use a function that modifies the data
in-place or a function that returns a modified copy and leaves the original unchanged.

Be careful when modifying data in-place. If two variables refer to the same list, and you modify
the list value, it will change for both variables!

```python
salsa = ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
my_salsa = salsa        # <-- my_salsa and salsa point to the *same* list data in memory
salsa[0] = 'hot peppers'
print('Ingredients in my salsa:', my_salsa)
```

```output
Ingredients in my salsa: ['hot peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
```

If you want variables with mutable values to be independent, you
must make a copy of the value when you assign it.

```python
salsa = ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
my_salsa = list(salsa)        # <-- makes a *copy* of the list
salsa[0] = 'hot peppers'
print('Ingredients in my salsa:', my_salsa)
```

```output
Ingredients in my salsa: ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
```

Because of pitfalls like this, code which modifies data in place can be more difficult to
understand. However, it is often far more efficient to modify a large data structure in place
than to create a modified copy for every small change. You should consider both of these aspects
when writing your code.

## Nested Lists
Since a list can contain any Python variables, it can even contain other lists.
For example, we could represent the products in the shelves of a small grocery shop:

```python
x = [['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion'],
     ['cabbage', 'lettuce', 'garlic'],
     ['apple', 'pear', 'banana']]
```

Here is a visual example of how indexing a list of lists `x` works:

[![x is represented as a pepper shaker containing several packets of pepper. \[x\[0\]\] is represented
as a pepper shaker containing a single packet of pepper. x\[0\] is represented as a single packet of
pepper. x\[0\]\[0\] is represented as single grain of pepper.  Adapted
from @hadleywickham.](fig/indexing_lists_python.png)](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/643381054758363136)

Using the previously declared list `x`, these would be the results of the
index operations shown in the image:

```python
print([x[0]])
```

```output
[['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion']]
```

```python
print(x[0])
```

```output
['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion']
```

```python
print(x[0][0])
```

```output
'pepper'
```

## Heterogeneous Lists
Lists in Python can contain elements of different types. Example:
```python
sample_ages = [10, 12.5, 'Unknown']
```

</div>

There are many ways to change the contents of lists besides assigning new values to
individual elements:

```python
odds.append(11)
print('odds after adding a value:', odds)
```

```output
odds after adding a value: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

```python
removed_element = odds.pop(0)
print('odds after removing the first element:', odds)
print('removed_element:', removed_element)
```

```output
odds after removing the first element: [3, 5, 7, 11]
removed_element: 1
```

```python
odds.reverse()
print('odds after reversing:', odds)
```

```output
odds after reversing: [11, 7, 5, 3]
```

While modifying in place, it is useful to remember that Python treats lists in a slightly
counter-intuitive way.

As we saw earlier, when we modified the `salsa` list item in-place, if we make a list, (attempt to) copy it and then modify this list, we can cause all sorts of trouble. This also applies to modifying the list using the above functions:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = odds
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
```

```output
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
```

This is because Python stores a list in memory, and then can use multiple names to refer to the
same list. If all we want to do is copy a (simple) list, we can again use the `list` function, so we do
not modify a list we did not mean to:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = list(odds)
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
```

```output
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

## Turn a String Into a List
Use a for-loop to convert the string "hello" into a list of letters:
```python
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

Hint: You can create an empty list like this:

```python
my_list = []
```

<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Solution
 
```python
my_list = []
for char in 'hello':
    my_list.append(char)
print(my_list)
```

</div>

</div>

Subsets of lists and strings can be accessed by specifying ranges of values in brackets,
similar to how we accessed ranges of positions in a NumPy array.
This is commonly referred to as "slicing" the list/string.

```python
binomial_name = 'Drosophila melanogaster'
group = binomial_name[0:10]
print('group:', group)

species = binomial_name[11:23]
print('species:', species)

chromosomes = ['X', 'Y', '2', '3', '4']
autosomes = chromosomes[2:5]
print('autosomes:', autosomes)

last = chromosomes[-1]
print('last:', last)
```

```output
group: Drosophila
species: melanogaster
autosomes: ['2', '3', '4']
last: 4
```

<div class='challenge' markdown='1'>

## Slicing From the End
Use slicing to access only the last four characters of a string or entries of a list.
```python
string_for_slicing = 'Observation date: 02-Feb-2013'
list_for_slicing = [['fluorine', 'F'],
                    ['chlorine', 'Cl'],
                    ['bromine', 'Br'],
                    ['iodine', 'I'],
                    ['astatine', 'At']]
```

```output
'2013'
[['chlorine', 'Cl'], ['bromine', 'Br'], ['iodine', 'I'], ['astatine', 'At']]
```

Would your solution work regardless of whether you knew beforehand
the length of the string or list
(e.g. if you wanted to apply the solution to a set of lists of different lengths)?
If not, try to change your approach to make it more robust.

Hint: Remember that indices can be negative as well as positive

<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Solution
 
Use negative indices to count elements from the end of a container (such as list or string):

```python
string_for_slicing[-4:]
list_for_slicing[-4:]
```

</div>

</div>

## Non-Continuous Slices
So far we've seen how to use slicing to take single blocks
of successive entries from a sequence.
But what if we want to take a subset of entries
that aren't next to each other in the sequence?
You can achieve this by providing a third argument
to the range within the brackets, called the *step size*.
The example below shows how you can take every third entry in a list:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[0:12:3]
print('subset', subset)
```

```output
subset [2, 7, 17, 29]
```

Notice that the slice taken begins with the first entry in the range,
followed by entries taken at equally-spaced intervals (the steps) thereafter.
If you wanted to begin the subset with the third entry,
you would need to specify that as the starting point of the sliced range:

```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[2:12:3]
print('subset', subset)
```

```output
subset [5, 13, 23, 37]
```

Use the step size argument to create a new string
that contains only every other character in the string
"In an octopus's garden in the shade". Start with
creating a variable to hold the string:

```python
beatles = "In an octopus's garden in the shade"
```

What slice of `beatles` will produce the
following output (i.e., the first character, third
character, and every other character through the end
of the string)?

```output
I notpssgre ntesae
```

<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Solution
 
To obtain every other character you need to provide a slice with the step
size of 2:

```python
beatles[0:35:2]
```

You can also leave out the beginning and end of the slice to take the whole string
and provide only the step argument to go every second
element:

```python
beatles[::2]
```

</div>

</div>

If you want to take a slice from the beginning of a sequence, you can omit the first index in the
range:

```python
date = 'Monday 4 January 2016'
day = date[0:6]
print('Using 0 to begin range:', day)
day = date[:6]
print('Omitting beginning index:', day)
```

```output
Using 0 to begin range: Monday
Omitting beginning index: Monday
```

And similarly, you can omit the ending index in the range to take a slice to the very end of the
sequence:

```python
months = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
sond = months[8:12]
print('With known last position:', sond)
sond = months[8:len(months)]
print('Using len() to get last entry:', sond)
sond = months[8:]
print('Omitting ending index:', sond)
```

```output
With known last position: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Using len() to get last entry: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Omitting ending index: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
```

<div class='challenge' markdown='1'>

## Overloading
`+` usually means addition, but when used on strings or lists, it means "concatenate".
Given that, what do you think the multiplication operator `*` does on lists?
In particular, what will be the output of the following code?
```python
counts = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
repeats = counts * 2
print(repeats)
```

1. `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
2. `[4, 8, 12, 16, 20]`
3. `[[2, 4, 6, 8, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]]`
4. `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]`

The technical term for this is *operator overloading*:
a single operator, like `+` or `*`,
can do different things depending on what it's applied to.

<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Solution
 
The multiplication operator `*` used on a list replicates elements of the list and concatenates
them together:

```output
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

It's equivalent to:

```python
counts + counts
```

- `[value1, value2, value3, ...]` creates a list.
- Lists can contain any Python object, including lists (i.e., list of lists).
- Lists are indexed and sliced with square brackets (e.g., list[0] and list[2:9]), in the same way as strings and arrays.
- Lists are mutable (i.e., their values can be changed in place).
- Strings are immutable (i.e., the characters in them cannot be changed).
