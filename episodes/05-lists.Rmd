```{questions}
#' - How can I store many values together?
```

Similar to a string that can contain many characters, a list is a container that can store many values.
Unlike NumPy arrays,
lists are built into the language (so we don't have to load a library
to use them).
We create a list by putting values inside square brackets and separating the values with commas:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
print('odds are:', odds)
```

```output
odds are: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

We can access elements of a list using indices -- numbered positions of elements in the list.
These positions are numbered starting at 0, so the first element has an index of 0.

```python
print('first element:', odds[0])
print('last element:', odds[3])
print('"-1" element:', odds[-1])
```

```output
first element: 1
last element: 7
"-1" element: 7
```

Yes, we can use negative numbers as indices in Python. When we do so, the index `-1` gives us the
last element in the list, `-2` the second to last, and so on.
Because of this, `odds[3]` and `odds[-1]` point to the same element here.

If we loop over a list, the loop variable is assigned to its elements one at a time:

```python
for number in odds:
    print(number)
```

```output
1
3
5
7
```

There is one important difference between lists and strings:
we can change the values in a list,
but we cannot change individual characters in a string.
For example:

```python
names = ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']  # typo in Darwin's name
print('names is originally:', names)
names[1] = 'Darwin'  # correct the name
print('final value of names:', names)
```

```output
names is originally: ['Curie', 'Darwing', 'Turing']
final value of names: ['Curie', 'Darwin', 'Turing']
```

works, but:

```python
name = 'Darwin'
name[0] = 'd'
```

```error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1 name = 'Darwin'
----> 2 name[0] = 'd'

#' ## Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
#' 
#' Data which can be modified in place is called [mutable](reference/#mutable),
#' while data which cannot be modified is called [immutable](reference/#immutable).
#' Strings and numbers are immutable. This does not mean that variables with string or number values
#' are constants, but when we want to change the value of a string or number variable, we can only
#' replace the old value with a completely new value.
#' 
#' Lists and arrays, on the other hand, are mutable: we can modify them after they have been
#' created. We can change individual elements, append new elements, or reorder the whole list. For
#' some operations, like sorting, we can choose whether to use a function that modifies the data
#' in-place or a function that returns a modified copy and leaves the original unchanged.
#' 
#' Be careful when modifying data in-place. If two variables refer to the same list, and you modify
#' the list value, it will change for both variables!
#' 
#' ```python
salsa = ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
my_salsa = salsa        # <-- my_salsa and salsa point to the *same* list data in memory
salsa[0] = 'hot peppers'
print('Ingredients in my salsa:', my_salsa)
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
Ingredients in my salsa: ['hot peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
#' ```
#' 
#' If you want variables with mutable values to be independent, you
#' must make a copy of the value when you assign it.
#' 
#' ```python
salsa = ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
my_salsa = list(salsa)        # <-- makes a *copy* of the list
salsa[0] = 'hot peppers'
print('Ingredients in my salsa:', my_salsa)
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
Ingredients in my salsa: ['peppers', 'onions', 'cilantro', 'tomatoes']
#' ```
#' 
#' Because of pitfalls like this, code which modifies data in place can be more difficult to
#' understand. However, it is often far more efficient to modify a large data structure in place
#' than to create a modified copy for every small change. You should consider both of these aspects
#' when writing your code.

#' ## Nested Lists
#' 
#' Since a list can contain any Python variables, it can even contain other lists.
#' 
#' For example, we could represent the products in the shelves of a small grocery shop:
#' 
#' ```python
x = [['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion'],
     ['cabbage', 'lettuce', 'garlic'],
     ['apple', 'pear', 'banana']]
#' ```
#' 
#' Here is a visual example of how indexing a list of lists `x` works:
#' 
#' [![x is represented as a pepper shaker containing several packets of pepper. \[x\[0\]\] is represented
#' as a pepper shaker containing a single packet of pepper. x\[0\] is represented as a single packet of
#' pepper. x\[0\]\[0\] is represented as single grain of pepper.  Adapted
#' from @hadleywickham.](fig/indexing_lists_python.png)](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/643381054758363136)
#' 
#' Using the previously declared list `x`, these would be the results of the
#' index operations shown in the image:
#' 
#' ```python
print([x[0]])
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
[['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion']]
#' ```
#' 
#' ```python
print(x[0])
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
['pepper', 'zucchini', 'onion']
#' ```
#' 
#' ```python
print(x[0][0])
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
'pepper'
#' ```

````{callout "203:1-209:12"}
#' ## Heterogeneous Lists
#' 
#' Lists in Python can contain elements of different types. Example:
#' 
#' ```python
sample_ages = [10, 12.5, 'Unknown']
#' ```
````

There are many ways to change the contents of lists besides assigning new values to
individual elements:

```python
odds.append(11)
print('odds after adding a value:', odds)
```

```output
odds after adding a value: [1, 3, 5, 7, 11]
```

```python
removed_element = odds.pop(0)
print('odds after removing the first element:', odds)
print('removed_element:', removed_element)
```

```output
odds after removing the first element: [3, 5, 7, 11]
removed_element: 1
```

```python
odds.reverse()
print('odds after reversing:', odds)
```

```output
odds after reversing: [11, 7, 5, 3]
```

While modifying in place, it is useful to remember that Python treats lists in a slightly
counter-intuitive way.

As we saw earlier, when we modified the `salsa` list item in-place, if we make a list, (attempt to) copy it and then modify this list, we can cause all sorts of trouble. This also applies to modifying the list using the above functions:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = odds
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
```

```output
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
```

This is because Python stores a list in memory, and then can use multiple names to refer to the
same list. If all we want to do is copy a (simple) list, we can again use the `list` function, so we do
not modify a list we did not mean to:

```python
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7]
primes = list(odds)
primes.append(2)
print('primes:', primes)
print('odds:', odds)
```

```output
primes: [1, 3, 5, 7, 2]
odds: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

#' ## Turn a String Into a List
#' 
#' Use a for-loop to convert the string "hello" into a list of letters:
#' 
#' ```python
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
#' ```
#' 
#' Hint: You can create an empty list like this:
#' 
#' ```python
my_list = []
#' ```
#'
#' @solution Solution
#' 
#' ```python
my_list = []
for char in 'hello':
    my_list.append(char)
print(my_list)
#' ```
````

Subsets of lists and strings can be accessed by specifying ranges of values in brackets,
similar to how we accessed ranges of positions in a NumPy array.
This is commonly referred to as "slicing" the list/string.

```python
binomial_name = 'Drosophila melanogaster'
group = binomial_name[0:10]
print('group:', group)

species = binomial_name[11:23]
print('species:', species)

chromosomes = ['X', 'Y', '2', '3', '4']
autosomes = chromosomes[2:5]
print('autosomes:', autosomes)

last = chromosomes[-1]
print('last:', last)
```

```output
group: Drosophila
species: melanogaster
autosomes: ['2', '3', '4']
last: 4
```

#' ## Slicing From the End
#' 
#' Use slicing to access only the last four characters of a string or entries of a list.
#' 
#' ```python
string_for_slicing = 'Observation date: 02-Feb-2013'
list_for_slicing = [['fluorine', 'F'],
                    ['chlorine', 'Cl'],
                    ['bromine', 'Br'],
                    ['iodine', 'I'],
                    ['astatine', 'At']]
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
'2013'
[['chlorine', 'Cl'], ['bromine', 'Br'], ['iodine', 'I'], ['astatine', 'At']]
#' ```
#' 
#' Would your solution work regardless of whether you knew beforehand
#' the length of the string or list
#' (e.g. if you wanted to apply the solution to a set of lists of different lengths)?
#' If not, try to change your approach to make it more robust.
#' 
#' Hint: Remember that indices can be negative as well as positive
#'
#' @solution Solution
#' 
#' Use negative indices to count elements from the end of a container (such as list or string):
#' 
#' ```python
string_for_slicing[-4:]
list_for_slicing[-4:]
#' ```

#' ## Non-Continuous Slices
#' 
#' So far we've seen how to use slicing to take single blocks
#' of successive entries from a sequence.
#' But what if we want to take a subset of entries
#' that aren't next to each other in the sequence?
#' 
#' You can achieve this by providing a third argument
#' to the range within the brackets, called the *step size*.
#' The example below shows how you can take every third entry in a list:
#' 
#' ```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[0:12:3]
print('subset', subset)
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
subset [2, 7, 17, 29]
#' ```
#' 
#' Notice that the slice taken begins with the first entry in the range,
#' followed by entries taken at equally-spaced intervals (the steps) thereafter.
#' If you wanted to begin the subset with the third entry,
#' you would need to specify that as the starting point of the sliced range:
#' 
#' ```python
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
subset = primes[2:12:3]
print('subset', subset)
#' ```
#' 
#' ```output
subset [5, 13, 23, 37]
#' ```
#' 
#' Use the step size argument to create a new string
#' that contains only every other character in the string
#' "In an octopus's garden in the shade". Start with
#' creating a variable to hold the string:
#' 
#' ```python
beatles = "In an octopus's garden in the shade"
#' ```
#' 
#' What slice of `beatles` will produce the
#' following output (i.e., the first character, third
#' character, and every other character through the end
#' of the string)?
#' 
#' ```output
I notpssgre ntesae
#' ```
#'
#' @solution Solution
#' 
#' To obtain every other character you need to provide a slice with the step
#' size of 2:
#' 
#' ```python
beatles[0:35:2]
#' ```
#' 
#' You can also leave out the beginning and end of the slice to take the whole string
#' and provide only the step argument to go every second
#' element:
#' 
#' ```python
beatles[::2]
#' ```
````

If you want to take a slice from the beginning of a sequence, you can omit the first index in the
range:

```python
date = 'Monday 4 January 2016'
day = date[0:6]
print('Using 0 to begin range:', day)
day = date[:6]
print('Omitting beginning index:', day)
```

```output
Using 0 to begin range: Monday
Omitting beginning index: Monday
```

And similarly, you can omit the ending index in the range to take a slice to the very end of the
sequence:

```python
months = ['jan', 'feb', 'mar', 'apr', 'may', 'jun', 'jul', 'aug', 'sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
sond = months[8:12]
print('With known last position:', sond)
sond = months[8:len(months)]
print('Using len() to get last entry:', sond)
sond = months[8:]
print('Omitting ending index:', sond)
```

```output
With known last position: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Using len() to get last entry: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
Omitting ending index: ['sep', 'oct', 'nov', 'dec']
```

#' ## Overloading
#' 
#' `+` usually means addition, but when used on strings or lists, it means "concatenate".
#' Given that, what do you think the multiplication operator `*` does on lists?
#' In particular, what will be the output of the following code?
#' 
#' ```python
counts = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
repeats = counts * 2
print(repeats)
#' ```
#' 
#' 1. `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
#' 2. `[4, 8, 12, 16, 20]`
#' 3. `[[2, 4, 6, 8, 10],[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]]`
#' 4. `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]`
#' 
#' The technical term for this is *operator overloading*:
#' a single operator, like `+` or `*`,
#' can do different things depending on what it's applied to.
#'
#' @solution Solution
#' 
#' The multiplication operator `*` used on a list replicates elements of the list and concatenates
#' them together:
#' 
#' ```output
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
#' ```
#' 
#' It's equivalent to:
#' 
#' ```python
counts + counts
